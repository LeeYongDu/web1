  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a worldwide information space where people can share
    information through computers connected to the Internet . Often referred to simply as the Web .
    The term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but is strictly a different concept.
    The web is just one service that works on the Internet, such as e-mail . However, since 1993,
    the web has occupied an absolute position in the Internet structure.
